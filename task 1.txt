Task 1: Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports

Objective:
Learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand network exposure.

Tools:
- Nmap (used)


STEPS:
1. Nmap installed from official website.
2. Local IP range identified: 192.168.1.0/24
3. Scan run with: nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
4. Open ports and IPs recorded.
5. Researched services associated with open ports.
6. Identified potential risks.



Pseudo Scan Results:

Scanning 192.168.1.0/24
Host: 192.168.1.1
    - Open Port: 80 (HTTP)
    - Open Port: 443 (HTTPS)
    - Open Port: 22 (SSH)

Host: 192.168.1.10
    - Open Port: 21 (FTP)
    - Open Port: 139 (NetBIOS)

Host: 192.168.1.15
    - Open Port: 445 (SMB)
    - Open Port: 3389 (RDP)

Potential Risks:
- Port 21 (FTP): Unencrypted credentials.
- Port 22 (SSH): Brute-force attack risk if weak passwords.
- Port 445 (SMB): Targeted in ransomware attacks.
- Port 3389 (RDP): Exposed RDP can be exploited for remote access.

Services and Their Purposes:
- HTTP/HTTPS: Web server
- SSH: Secure shell access
- FTP: File transfer service
- SMB: File and printer sharing
- RDP: Remote desktop

Conclusion:
Basic reconnaissance reveals several potentially risky services exposed.

Nmap Basic Usage and Scan Types:


1. TCP SYN Scan (Stealth Scan):
   - Command: `nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24`
   - Description: Sends SYN packets and waits for SYN-ACK to detect open ports without completing the handshake.

2. TCP Connect Scan:
   - Command: `nmap -sT 192.168.1.0/24`
   - Description: Performs full TCP handshake. Easier to detect but does not require special privileges.

3. UDP Scan:
   - Command: `nmap -sU 192.168.1.0/24`
   - Description: Scans for open UDP ports. Slower but useful for detecting services like DNS, SNMP.

4. Service and Version Detection:
   - Command: `nmap -sV 192.168.1.0/24`
   - Description: Tries to determine what service/version is running on open ports.

5. OS Detection:
   - Command: `nmap -O 192.168.1.0/24`
   - Description: Attempts to determine the operating system of hosts.

6. Combine Options:
   - Command: `nmap -sS -sV -O 192.168.1.0/24`
   - Description: Runs SYN scan with version and OS detection.

7. Save Output:
   - Command: `nmap -oN scan_results.txt 192.168.1.0/24`
   - Description: Saves output to a text file.
